                <h2>What to Consider Before Investing in Residential Property</h2>
                <h3>○ Location</h3>

                <h3>○ Financing and Budget</h3>
                <p>Residential property requires a significant upfront investment, whether it’s for a down payment or renovation costs. Carefully assess your financing options and create a realistic budget.</p>

                <h3>○ Legal Considerations</h3>
                <p>Real estate laws and regulations vary by location. Consult with a real estate attorney or agent to understand zoning laws, tenant rights, and any restrictions that apply to your property type.</p>

                <h3>○ Property Management</h3>
                <p>If you’re purchasing a rental property, consider whether you’ll manage the property yourself or hire a property management company. Managing tenants and maintaining the property can be time-consuming and challenging.</p>
